Project 1  snake game
A classic snake game built using Python and Pygame. Control the snake with arrow keys, eat food to grow, and avoid colliding with yourself. The game features screen wrapping, real-time score tracking, and smooth gameplay using object-oriented design.
Project 2 Tic Tac Toe game 
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3×3 grid. The first player uses 'X', and the second uses '0'. Players take turns clicking on empty squares to place their symbol, aiming to get three in a row — vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

This Python version of Tic Tac Toe uses Tkinter, a built-in GUI library, to create an interactive interface where:

Each move updates the board.

The game announces the winner or a tie.

A Restart button resets the game for a new match.
